## 📖 The project:

### About:

The project was made on the Scratch platform, as part of a code/project challenge from Harvard's CS50 course (week 0). It consists of a simple yet fun game. The objective of the game is simple: Do not let the enemies reach the princess. The game itself does not have an end; it's like a survival against time. The game is playable only with the mouse and features various types of enemies with different attributes.

### Advice:

If you want the game file, you can download it right here from this repository on GitHub. The file is at your disposal!

## 👨‍💻 Problem Set 0:

### Scratch:

It’s time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch, at scratch.mit.edu, any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Ivy’s Hardest Game.

To meet these requirements, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall. And your code should ideally be not only correct but also well-designed. If one of your scripts is getting a bit long, try to break it up into multiple scripts (each of which does something specific). And try to leverage “abstraction” where possible: if you can imagine giving a descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g., meow), those could probably be moved to a custom block!
